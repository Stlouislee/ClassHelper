## Introduction

After studying in University for about two years, we find that the most asked question is:  **Which classroom should I go for the next coming class?** Usually, we will open the curriculum schedule, find the course and its classroom. It takes time and we need to keeping zooming in and out to see it clear. 

Also, we find that a Todo-List is very helpful in our University life, so we won't forget to submit our homework again.

And, as we're majoring in Computer Science, most of our course books are in digital form, which makes us keep searching and searching (because we have tons of files in our disk and they're obviously not managed well).

So, here's why we made ClassHelper. It helps you find the classroom, it helps keeping your Todo-list, also, it helps you with the management of your course books.

In short, ClassHelper is providing you:

* a brief information of the upcoming class
* a todo-list linked with your courses.
* a personal library which store the textbooks you need in the courses.
